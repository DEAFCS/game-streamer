# Boot-time hardware auto-tune. The fleet spans GTX 980-class (Maxwell) to
# RTX 50-series and a wide range of CPUs, so a single hardcoded config is
# either too heavy for the weak nodes or leaves the strong ones idle. This
# detects the GPU class + CPU core count and sets the capture/cs2 perf knobs
# per node so each card runs at its sweet spot.
#
# Every value is set with `:=` (or an explicit-unset guard), so an env /
# pod-spec override ALWAYS wins â€” auto-tune only fills in what wasn't pinned.
#
# Sets when unset: CS2_THREADS, GS_GPU_SCALE. Emits advisories for the
# knobs it deliberately won't change silently (FPS halving, codec â€” which is
# playback-gated, not encode-gated). Sourced by run-live.sh / run-demo.sh;
# depends on log/warn from common.sh.
